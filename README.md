Mental Health in Tech: Big Data & Machine Learning Insights

Mental health challenges are widespread in the tech industry, yet often under-discussed. I analyzed a large-scale mental health survey of 1,200+ tech professionals using big data analytics and machine learning to uncover critical insights about burnout, anxiety, and workplace well-being.

🔹 PySpark & MLlib – Scaled data processing and built classification models to identify risk factors based on workplace pressure, demographics, and remote work effects.
🔹 Pandas & NumPy – Cleaned and engineered features from diverse survey data for effective model training.
🔹 Tableau Visualizations – Crafted interactive dashboards illustrating correlations between work culture, stigma, and mental health outcomes.
🔹 Data-Driven Recommendations – Highlighted actionable strategies for improving mental health support tailored to tech employees' unique needs.

🧠 This project reflects my passion for leveraging data science and AI to tackle mental health challenges and promote healthier, more supportive workplaces in fast-paced tech environments.

“Data-driven insights aren’t just numbers—they’re the key to unlocking better mental well-being for tech professionals worldwide.”
